# = Getting started
#
# The GNU Scientific Library ({GSL}[https://gnu.org/software/gsl/])
# is a collection of routines for numerical computing.
# The routines have been written from scratch in C, and present a modern Applications
# Programming Interface (API) for C programmers, allowing wrappers to be
# written for very  high level languages. The source code is distributed
# under the GNU General Public License.
#
# The {Ruby/GSL}[https://sciruby.github.com/rb-gsl] is Ruby
# bindings for GSL. This provides higher-level interfaces to the GSL functions.
# See {here}[link:rdoc/use_rdoc.html] for installation. To use the library , just put at the head of your scripts <tt>require("gsl")</tt>, or type it from the command line of <tt>irb</tt>.
